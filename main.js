/* The code below is set up to demonstrate three functions that run on the Sphero RVR. Each function runs a single stage.


Stage one: drive forward three VEX field tiles (120 cm) using a PID algorithm at a heading of 90 degrees.
Note: This uses the y-coordinate of the robot as the setpoint.

Stage two - make a 90 degree turn using Weinberg's hacky method that also happens to work really well.

Stage three - drive forward two tiles on the floor at a heading of 90 degrees.
Note: this stage uses the x-coordinate of the robot as the setpoint.

Take a look at the code to get an idea of how each one works.

Your task is to plan a ten stage path on the VEX field using a series of commands like these.

One catch is that each of you must contribute three stages yourself as commits to this repository.

Another catch is that your stages should be submitted as issues on this repository, and as they are completed, closed by you (or me).

I will be syncing with this repository on my computer and pasting the code into the Sphero RVR software for testing purposes.
